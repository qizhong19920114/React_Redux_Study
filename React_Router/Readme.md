#This is a react router tutorial from eggheadIO

##Note
This [tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-react-router) is kind of boring. Doesn't quite explain why use some of the features but more on the how. Well, maybe I will understand better when I start doing my own app

##Run 
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

open browser to http://localhost:3333
