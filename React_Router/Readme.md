#This is a react router tutorial from eggheadIO

This [tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-react-router) is kind of boring. Doesn't quite explain why use some of the features but more on the how. Well, maybe I will understand better when I start doing my own app

##Run: 
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

open browser to http://localhost:3333

##Note: 
I spent quite a while trying to figure out what went wrong because it keep saying **Multi Main** error when I did **npm run start**. Then after a little comparing, I realized that the **.babelrc** file is missing in the src folder. Just add that then it will fix the error!
