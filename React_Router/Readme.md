#This is a react router tutorial from eggheadIO

##Note: 
This tutorial is kind of boring. Doesn't quite explain why use some of the features but more on the how. Well, maybe I will understand better when I start doing my own app

##Run 
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

open browser to http://localhost:3333
