#gitNoteTaker React JS example from Tyler Mcginnis

This example is an ReactJS example using firebase as the database. The app fetches the github repo data based on the search name 
and we can take notes on each repo holder.

### Instructions

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
then open the index.html file

I did some modification on this example because the new firebase needs a different syntax. I was a little lazy towards the end
when Tyler was taking about refactoring the code to the new ES6 syntax. I didn't do those changes so if you want to know, you 
can refer to the Tyler's original repo (I provided the link below)
