#Think in React Example

I did this extra example for practice mainly because I was still having some confusion about the following things:
- when to use state?
- when to use props?
- Where to put state?
- How does React one way data flow works if we want to update state based on user action?

This example answers it all. See the **Notes** section 

Just a little spoiler of how data flow works: 

**The idea is that while data flows from parent to child, events can go the other way.**

##Run:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
The web should be available at localhost:3000.
