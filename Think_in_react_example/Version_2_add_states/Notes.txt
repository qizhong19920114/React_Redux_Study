Notes: 

- a component should ideally only do one thing

- Damn, I always forgot export default...

- In **simpler examples**, it's usually easier to go **top-down**, but on **larger projects**, it's easier to go **bottom-up** and write tests as you build

- State vs Props: see the state vs Props file

- I know this is very basic but I did forgot... this is how you use the style sheet in the html: 
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css"> 

- Figure out the **absolute minimal** representation of the **state** your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand

- Here is how to figure out if a component needs state: 
	Let's go through each one and figure out which one is state. Simply ask three questions about each piece of data:

	1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.
	2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn't state.
	3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't state.

- Use **indexOf()** to check if a string is contained by the other string
	example here: if (product.name.indexOf(this.props.filterText) === -1 )

- There's a little error in the original tutorial. The forEach we need to use .bind(this) so we can access the this.props.filterText
