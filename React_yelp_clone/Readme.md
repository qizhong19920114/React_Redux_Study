#React Yelp Clone Tutorial

This is a long ass tutorial I need to follow, I may encouner some difficults in the process but I will do my best to figure it out. I will take may notes along the way because the tutorial is just too long

- It's a little weird the tutorial is using webpack-hjs, which makes a lot of things different. 
- **Font Awesome** is a cool library to have to display rating stars
- I like the part in the code that talks about test (karma, chai, mocha); Well, the setup is the pain the butt
- I don't like how a big portion of this is just config ...
- Finally get to routing, some errors in the router section. the class getter should have "get" keyword 
- A lot of css part I'm not quote familiar with. CSS part could be my weakness
- The tutorial missed a big part of Item, Listing and Rating
- I like the trick here for displaying the rating using width proterty, and overlap two rows of stars and one has the content width determined by the rating calculation. 
- If you use **nested router**, you can keep the parent content and the children content will show besides the parent content when the route is point at the children content
- We can pass the reference down as a prop to the child elements by cloning children and creating a new instance to handle passing down data.React makes this process easy to handle by using the **React.cloneElement()**. ```This is how we pass reference from parent to children in a nested route situation.```
