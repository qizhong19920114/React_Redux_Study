#React Yelp Clone Tutorial

This is a long ass tutorial I need to follow, I may encouner some difficults in the process but I will do my best to figure it out. I will take may notes along the way because the tutorial is just too long

- It's a little weird the tutorial is using webpack-hjs, which makes a lot of things different. 
- **Font Awesome** is a cool library to have to display rating stars
- I like the part in the code that talks about test (karma, chai, mocha); Well, the setup is the pain the butt
- I don't like how a big portion of this is just config ...
- Finally get to routing
